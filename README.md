# CSC418 Assignment 3: Ray Tracer
 In the assignment I implemented the algorithms used to draw scenes with ray tracing. This includes ray casting, ray intersection with primitive and Phong Illumination. Along with the basic features I implemented global illumination, allowing my ray tracer to create shadows and relfections. And, lastly I implemented anti-aliasing.
