# CSC418 Assignment 3: Ray Tracer
 In the assignment I implemented the algorithms used to draw scenes with ray tracing. This includes ray casting, ray intersection with primitive and Phong Illumination. Along with the basic features I implemented global illumination, allowing my ray tracer to create shadows and relfections. And, lastly I implemented anti-aliasing.
 
 ## Part 1: Basic Intersection
 
 In the first part of this assignment I had to implement the intersection algorithm with a sphere and a plane. These are the results.

## Part 2: Illumination

In this part of the assignment I implemented diffuse shading and Phong shading using the phong illumination model.
